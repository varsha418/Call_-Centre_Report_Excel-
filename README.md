**Tool Used:**
Pivot Tables
Power Pivot
Slicers
Conditional Formatting
DAX
Interactive Chart

**Key Techniques**
1. Pivot Tables
 Pivot Tables to quickly summarize large call center data — like calculating total calls, amount, and duration grouped by representatives, cities, or days. It's great for dynamic summarization and forming the base of your visuals.
2. Setting Up the Data Model
Linked different data tables (calls, reps, ratings, etc.) using relationships, making it easier to create complex dashboards. This setup allows the use of slicers and filters across visuals.
3. DAX Measures for KPIs
 Created DAX Measures to calculate: Total Calls,Total Amount,Average Rating, Happy Callers & DAX makes KPIs dynamic — update automatically based on slicer selections (like selecting a specific rep or city).
4. Call Trend Graph
This is the line chart showing monthly call activity (Jan to Dec). & created it to track performance trends over time and identify peaks (like March) and dips (like July).
5. Weekday Trend Bar Graph
Built a horizontal bar graph to show call volume by day of the week, helping analyze when most customers are contacting — key for staffing and planning.
6. Call & Amount by Rep – Dynamic Chart
Built bar charts that dynamically update when a user selects a representative. It helps compare each rep’s performance based on: Number of calls & Amount generated.
7. Formatting Slicers with Styles
Used slicers to filter data interactively (by rep, city, etc.) and styled them to match the dashboard’s theme — making it user-friendly and professional.
8. Call by Customer Demographics
This includes gender breakdown per city (e.g., female vs. male in Cincinnati, Cleveland, and Columbus), which shows user behavior by location and can help in campaign targeting.
9. Customer Revenue Analysis
 Analyzed how much each customer code (C0001, C0004, etc.) contributed across different reps — useful for identifying valuable clients and revenue patterns.
10. Conditional Formatting – Data Bars
Applied data bars in the revenue table to visually show which reps or customers are contributing more. It makes reading tables faster and clearer.
11. Rating Distribution Histogram
The bar chart with ratings 1 to 5 shows how satisfied customers were — e.g., most gave 4 and 5 stars. This helps measure customer experience quality.
12. Highlighted Selected Rep
Using slicers or filters, highlighted one rep (like R01) and displayed their performance clearly, along with ranks and percentages — helping managers focus on individuals.
13. Making the Dashboard
Brought all visuals together using:Clean layout,Grouped metrics,Consistent color scheme & KPI cards and charts

 **Key Highlights**
 
1.Volume and Engagement
  We handled 1,000 calls, with 189 handled by our top rep R01. The total duration of calls was nearly 90,000 minutes, showing strong customer engagement.
  
2.Financial Performance
   Generated $96,623 in total, with R02 contributing the highest at $20.9K, followed by R03 and R05. This indicates R02 is not only handling calls well but also generating high value.
   
3.Call Trends
  Call volume peaked in March, suggesting a seasonal trend or successful campaign. The lowest was in July, possibly due to holidays or low marketing activity.
  
4.Customer Satisfaction
 Achieved an average rating of 3.9, with 307 happy callers. Most ratings clustered around 4 and 5, indicating overall satisfaction but with room to grow.
 
5. Demographics and Timing
 Interestingly, Saturday had the highest call volume, followed by Sunday, suggesting we need strong weekend staffing. In terms of caller demographics, Columbus had the highest female callers (206), while Cincinnati had a more balanced distribution.

7. Rep Performance
Looking at individual performance, R02 and R03 consistently show strong numbers in both amount and call handling. This helps us identify training opportunities for lower-performing reps.

**Conclusion and Action Points**
Overall, our call center shows strong performance in key areas. Going forward, we should:
 -Focus on improving ratings through training.
 -Allocate more resources on weekends.
 -Analyze low-performing months like July to identify opportunities.
